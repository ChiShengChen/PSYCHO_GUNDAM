> A pioneering system integrating EEG and deep learning for real-time robotic control.

## Update
This paper has been accepted by [2024 13th International Symposium on ACG Culture and Technology Studies](https://u-acg.com/archives/29015).

## Abstract
This project introduces a novel EEG-based robotic control system inspired by the **Psycho Frame** from the Gundam universe, allowing real-time robotic actions based on human cognitive commands. By capturing brainwave data using an EMOTIV+ EEG cap and processing it through deep learning algorithms, we achieve intuitive control over robotic systems, aiming to expand human-machine interaction capabilities.
